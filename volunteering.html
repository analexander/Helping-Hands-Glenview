<h3>Volunteering</h3>

<p>The major volunteer activity with Helping Hands is driving our senior and disabled residents to medical appointments,
necessary shopping trips or personal care visits. This assistance is greatly appreciated by our clients and is a key ingredient in
enabling them to remain in their own homes. Trips provided by our volunteers take no more than two hours and are usually within five
miles one-way and never more than ten. We always need new drivers, and welcome your interest in this activity.</p>

<p>A volunteer can drive as often or as seldom as desired. Attached is a <a href="pdf/hhog_volunteer_driver.pdf">Volunteer Driver Form</a> which gives the driver the
opportunity to indicate preferences. In addition to this completed form, we are required to have a copy of your automobile insurance
card and a copy of your Illinois Driver's license. Note that licenses renewed by mail provide a sticker to attach to the back of
your license, and we need to have a copy of that expiration date.</p>

<p>If you would like to register as a driver for Helping Hands, simply print this form, complete it and mail it along with your
driver's license and insurance information to the address indicated on the form. Or, if you would prefer to speak with someone about
volunteering for Helping Hands, please call (847) 729-8181.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your interest in volunteering for Helping Hands. We are confident you will find your involvement very
rewarding!</p>
