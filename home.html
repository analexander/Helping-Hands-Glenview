<h3>Helping Hands of Glenview</h3>
<h4>Serving the special needs of our village's elderly and disabled residents</h4>

<p><b>Helping Hands</b> was founded in 1988 as a local non-profit service organization whose goal is to assist the Glenview
elderly and/or disabled. We provide transportation for appointments, sponsor an annual yard cleanup and occasionally provide
financial assistance for specific needs.</p>

<p><b>Transportation</b> to and from medical appointments, local shops and grocery stores is provided free of charge. We do have
a maximum of two rides per week per client. <b>We provide approximately 75-100 rides every month!</b> So we have a constant need for
new volunteers to assist with the driving.</p>

<p><b>Special Assistance</b> is provided by a <b>Helping Hands</b> fund administered in consultation with local social workers. This
fund provides one-time financial aid for essential needs of senior and disabled residents of Glenview. It also assists in the
purchase of furniture and equipment needed by other organizations (Glenview Public Library, Glenview Senior Center, Patten House,
etc.) to aid the elderly and disabled. This assistance is made possible through the charitable contributions we receive annually.
Contributions can be sent to <b>Helping Hands</b> using the membership form available on this site. For more information contact the
Glenview Senior Services Coordinator at 847-904-4366.</p>

<p><b>Other Outreach Activities</b> send <b>Helping Hands</b> volunteers all over the Glenview area - literally! Seasonal projects
include an annual yard cleanup, cosponsored by <b>Helping Hands</b> and Glenbrook South High School Service clubs. Scouts and other local
Service groups also join in the fun. In all its activities, <b>Helping Hands</b> enlists volunteers of many different ages and walks of
life.</p>

<p><b>Volunteering</b> for an hour or two each week or month is incredibly rewarding. Responding to the simplest needs of the
elderly can ease a burden that otherwise could seem overwhelming.<br />
Volunteers are always needed to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drive</li>
    <li>Serve on Committees</li>
    <li>Assess senior needs</li>
</ul>
<i>Call us to join......we need your help for as little as an hour a month to several hours a week. Add
your name to our list of volunteers by calling us at (847) 729-8181.</i>

<b>Membership</b> in <b>Helping Hands of Glenview</b> is open to all individuals, families,
